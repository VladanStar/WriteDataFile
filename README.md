WriteDataFile
Make a program that writes numbers from 1 to 10 in a text file so that each number is one below the other. After this, load the numbers from the file, place them in a series of numbers, and then multiply each number by 5 and place it in the file again. Explanation: To read a text file we can use the BufferedReader we mentioned so far when we read from the console. We put FileReader in the constructor of BufferedReader and pass it the file name for loading. The While loop allows us to read each line of the file separately and add it as an Integer to the string. We must parse each line into Integer first using Integer.parseInt.
